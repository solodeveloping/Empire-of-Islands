# GECS Best Practices Guide

> **Write maintainable, performant ECS code**

This guide covers proven patterns and practices for building robust games with GECS. Apply these patterns to keep your code clean, fast, and easy to debug.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)
- Understanding of [Core Concepts](CORE_CONCEPTS.md)

## Component Design Patterns

### Keep Components Pure Data

Components should only hold data, never logic or behavior.

```gdscript
# Good - Pure data component
class_name C_Health
extends Component

@export var current: float = 100.0
@export var maximum: float = 100.0
@export var regeneration_rate: float = 1.0

func _init(max_health: float = 100.0):
    maximum = max_health
    current = max_health
```

```gdscript
# Avoid - Logic in components
class_name C_Health
extends Component

@export var current: float = 100.0
@export var maximum: float = 100.0

# This belongs in a system, not a component
func take_damage(amount: float):
    current -= amount
    if current <= 0:
        print("Entity died!")
```

### Use Composition Over Inheritance

Build entities by combining simple components rather than complex inheritance hierarchies.

```gdscript
# Good - Composable components via define_components() or scene setup
class_name Player
extends Entity

func define_components() -> Array:
    return [
        C_Health.new(100),
        C_Transform.new(),
        C_Input.new()
    ]

class_name Enemy
extends Entity

func define_components() -> Array:
    return [
        C_Health.new(50),
        C_Transform.new(),
        C_AI.new()
    ]
```

### Design for Configuration

Make components easily configurable through export properties.

```gdscript
# Good - Configurable component
class_name C_Movement
extends Component

@export var speed: float = 100.0
@export var acceleration: float = 500.0
@export var friction: float = 800.0
@export var max_speed: float = 300.0
@export var can_fly: bool = false

func _init(spd: float = 100.0, can_fly_: bool = false):
    speed = spd
    can_fly = can_fly_
```

## System Design Patterns

### Single Responsibility Principle

Each system should handle one specific concern.

```gdscript
# Good - Focused systems
class_name MovementSystem extends System
func query(): return q.with_all([C_Position, C_Velocity])

class_name RenderSystem extends System
func query(): return q.with_all([C_Position, C_Sprite])

class_name HealthSystem extends System
func query(): return q.with_all([C_Health])
```

### Use System Groups for Processing Order

Organize systems into logical groups using scene-based organization. Systems are grouped in scene nodes and processed in the correct order.

```gdscript
# main.gd - Process systems in correct order
func _process(delta):
    world.process(delta, "run-first")  # Initialization systems
    world.process(delta, "input")      # Input handling
    world.process(delta, "gameplay")   # Game logic
    world.process(delta, "ui")         # UI updates
    world.process(delta, "run-last")   # Cleanup systems

func _physics_process(delta):
    world.process(delta, "physics")    # Physics systems
    world.process(delta, "debug")      # Debug systems
```

### Early Exit for Performance

Return early from system processing when no work is needed.

```gdscript
# Good - Early exit patterns
class_name HealthRegenerationSystem extends System

func query():
    return q.with_all([C_Health]).with_none([C_Dead])

func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        var health = entity.get_component(C_Health)

        # Early exit if already at max health
        if health.current >= health.maximum:
            continue

        # Apply regeneration
        health.current = min(health.current + health.regeneration_rate * delta, health.maximum)
```

### Use CommandBuffer for Structural Changes During Iteration

When adding/removing components, entities, or relationships during system processing, use the `cmd` CommandBuffer instead of direct world/entity calls. This allows safe forward iteration and deferred cache invalidation.

```gdscript
# Good - Use CommandBuffer for safe iteration
class_name LifetimeSystem extends System

func query():
    return q.with_all([C_Lifetime])

func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        var lifetime = entity.get_component(C_Lifetime)
        lifetime.time -= delta
        if lifetime.time <= 0:
            cmd.remove_entity(entity)  # Queued, executed after system completes
```

```gdscript
# Avoid - Direct removal during iteration requires backwards iteration
func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    for i in range(entities.size() - 1, -1, -1):
        if should_delete(entities[i]):
            ECS.world.remove_entity(entities[i])  # Modifies array during iteration
```

**Flush Modes** (`command_buffer_flush_mode: FlushMode`) control when queued commands execute:

- **FlushMode.PER_SYSTEM** (default) — executes after each system completes
- **FlushMode.PER_GROUP** — executes after all systems in the group complete
- **FlushMode.MANUAL** — requires explicit `ECS.world.flush_command_buffers()` call

## Code Organization Patterns

### GECS Naming Conventions

```gdscript
# GECS Standard naming patterns:

# Components: C_ComponentName class, c_component_name.gd file
class_name C_Health extends Component      # c_health.gd
class_name C_Position extends Component    # c_position.gd

# Systems: SystemNameSystem class, s_system_name.gd file
class_name MovementSystem extends System   # s_movement.gd
class_name RenderSystem extends System     # s_render.gd

# Entities: EntityName class, e_entity_name.gd file
class_name Player extends Entity           # e_player.gd
class_name Enemy extends Entity            # e_enemy.gd

# Observers: ObserverNameObserver class, o_observer_name.gd file
class_name HealthUIObserver extends Observer  # o_health_ui.gd
```

### File Organization

Organize your ECS files by theme for better scalability:

```
project/
├── components/
│   ├── ai/              # AI-related components
│   ├── animation/       # Animation components

```

## Entity Glue Code: What Belongs on the Entity vs. a Component

An `Entity` subclass is the bridge between Godot's scene tree and the ECS world. It's the right home for **glue** — handles and setup logic that don't meet the bar for becoming a component. Getting this split right keeps components lean (and serializable) and keeps systems fast (no unnecessary indirection).

**Put it on the Entity subclass as glue when:**

- It's a reference to the entity's OWN scene-tree child (`NavigationAgent3D`, `CollisionShape3D`, `AnimationPlayer`, camera anchor, skeleton attachment).
- It never changes at runtime — no system ever adds, removes, or swaps it.
- No system ever queries by it. You will never write `q.with_all([C_ThatThing])`.
- It can't serialize as data anyway — Node references aren't `Resource`-safe.

**Put it in a `C_*` component instead when:**

- Multiple entity types share the concept and should be queried uniformly.
- A system filters on its presence/absence (`with_all`, `with_none`).
- It can appear, disappear, or be hot-swapped at runtime.
- It's pure data (numbers, vectors, enums, arrays, strings).

**Canonical example — caching a child node once at `_ready`:**

```gdscript
class_name Sheep
extends Entity

## Cached handle to our own scene child. Resolved once; systems read it
## directly instead of doing get_node_or_null(...) per frame per sheep.
@onready var nav_agent: NavigationAgent3D = get_node_or_null(^"NavigationAgent3D")

func define_components() -> Array:
    return [C_Sheep.new(), C_Wander.new(), C_Velocity.new()]
```

```gdscript
# In the system — no per-frame scene-tree walk, no Dictionary lookup.
func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float) -> void:
    for i in entities.size():
        var sheep := entities[i] as Sheep
        var agent := sheep.nav_agent
        ...
```

**Anti-pattern — making it a component for no reason:**

```gdscript
# DON'T: C_NavAgent with a NavigationAgent3D field. Resource can't serialize
# a Node reference cleanly, no system queries by presence of this, and the
# hot loop now pays an entity.get_component() Dictionary lookup to unwrap it.
class_name C_NavAgent
extends Component
@export var agent: NavigationAgent3D  # ← don't
```

**Rule of thumb:** if you removed the field from the Entity subclass, would any system's **query** break? If yes → component. If no (only a specific system's *internals* change) → entity glue.

## Casting an Entity to Its Class (and the Node3D Pitfall)

`Entity extends Node`. Your `class_name MyEntity extends Entity` script is attached to a scene whose root is typically `Node3D` (or `CharacterBody3D`, `Area3D`, etc.) — but the **static type** of `MyEntity` is still just `Entity`, i.e. a `Node`. Godot's static type checker doesn't propagate the scene-root type into the script's class hierarchy.

This has two practical consequences in hot-loop systems.

### 1. One cast covers both APIs

Once you have a `MyEntity`-typed local, you can read **both** the Entity API (`get_component`, `get_relationships`, `add_component`) **and** the runtime Node3D properties on the scene root (`global_position`, `global_transform`, custom `@onready` glue) directly off the same variable. Godot's editor resolves Node3D properties against the script's scene root for class_name'd scripts.

```gdscript
# Single cast — both APIs work off `sheep`.
for i in entities.size():
    var sheep := entities[i] as Sheep
    if sheep == null:
        continue
    var c_wander := sheep.get_component(C_Wander) as C_Wander  # Entity API
    var pos: Vector3 = sheep.global_position                     # Scene-root API
    var agent := sheep.nav_agent                                 # Entity glue
```

**Don't** double-cast through `Node` to get `Node3D` access:

```gdscript
# Anti-pattern — three casts and a redundant null check for the same object.
var sheep_entity := entity as Sheep
var sheep := (entity as Node) as Node3D
if sheep == null or sheep_entity == null:
    continue
```

### 2. Sibling casts are rejected — relax helper signatures

The static checker rejects `Entity → CharacterBody3D` and `Entity → Node3D` because `Entity` and `Node3D` are siblings under `Node`, not in an ancestor-descendant chain. Two situations hit this:

**a) Inside the system, when you need a typed Node3D / CharacterBody3D variable:**

Upcast to `Node` first (free since `Entity extends Node`), then downcast:

```gdscript
# Heterogeneous query — entities[] contains different scene-root types.
var node: Node = entities[i]
var body := node as CharacterBody3D
if body:
    body.velocity = ...
    body.move_and_slide()
    continue
var node_3d := node as Node3D
if node_3d:
    node_3d.global_position += ...
```

**b) When passing entities to helper functions:**

If a helper is typed `func face(node: Node3D, ...)`, calling `face(sheep, ...)` is rejected. The fix is **on the helper**, not at the call site — relax the parameter to `Node` and downcast inside:

```gdscript
# Helper accepts any Node, downcasts internally. Now Sheep / Shepherd / any
# Entity-typed thing can be passed in without ceremony.
static func face(node: Node, direction: Vector3, speed: float, delta: float) -> void:
    var node_3d := node as Node3D
    if node_3d == null:
        return
    # ... use node_3d.global_transform ...
```

For helpers that need *both* the Entity API and Node3D properties (e.g. flocking, which reads `global_position` *and* `get_relationships`), take the entity's class type directly:

```gdscript
# Was: compute(self_node: Node3D, self_entity: Entity, ...) — same sheep twice.
static func compute(self_sheep: Sheep, c_flocking: C_Flocking) -> Vector3:
    var self_pos: Vector3 = self_sheep.global_position
    var rels := self_sheep.get_relationships(R_AnyFlockmate)
    ...
```

**Rule of thumb:** in systems, do `var x := entities[i] as MyEntity` once and use `x` for everything. If a helper rejects the typed entity, fix the helper's signature (take `Node` or the concrete entity class) — don't add casts at every call site.

## Common Game Patterns

### Player Character Pattern

> This is all just glue code to initialize, and setup entities to be used with the ECS.
> You should avoid wanting to put gameplay stuff here, but if you must it's not a problem at all.

```gdscript
# e_player.gd
class_name Player
extends Entity

func on_ready():
    # Common pattern: sync scene transform to component
    if has_component(C_Transform):
        var transform_comp = get_component(C_Transform)
        transform_comp.transform = global_transform
    add_to_group("player")
```

### Enemy Pattern

> This is all just glue code to initialize, and setup entities to be used with the ECS.
> You should avoid wanting to put gameplay stuff here, but if you must it's not a problem at all.

```gdscript
# e_enemy.gd
class_name Enemy
extends Entity

func on_ready():
    # Sync transform and add to enemy group
    if has_component(C_Transform):
        var transform_comp = get_component(C_Transform)
        transform_comp.transform = global_transform
    add_to_group("enemies")
```

## Performance Best Practices

### Choose the Right Query Method

**Query Performance Ranking** (10,000 entities, Godot 4.6-dev3):

```gdscript
# FASTEST - Enabled/disabled queries (constant time regardless of entity count)
class_name ActiveEntitiesOnly extends System
func query():
    return q.enabled()  # ~0.11ms for any number of entities

# EXCELLENT - Component queries (heavily optimized with indexing)
class_name MovementSystem extends System
func query():
    return q.with_all([C_Position, C_Velocity])  # ~0.24ms for 10K entities

# GOOD - Use with_any strategically
class_name DamageableSystem extends System
func query():
    return q.with_any([C_Player, C_Enemy]).with_all([C_Health])  # ~0.31ms for 10K

# AVOID - Group queries are slowest (Godot SceneTree traversal)
class_name PlayerSystem extends System
func query():
    return q.with_group(["player"])  # ~13.6ms for 10K entities
    # Better: q.with_all([C_Player])
```

### Use iterate() for Batch Performance

```gdscript
# Good - Batch processing with iterate()
class_name TransformSystem
extends System

func query():
    # Use iterate() to get component arrays
    return q.with_all([C_Transform]).iterate([C_Transform])

func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    # Batch access to components for better performance
    var transforms = components[0]  # C_Transform array from iterate()
    for i in range(entities.size()):
        entities[i].global_transform = transforms[i].transform
```

### Use Specific Queries

```gdscript
# BEST - Combine enabled filter with components
class_name ActivePlayerInputSystem extends System
func query():
    return q.with_all([C_Input, C_Movement]).enabled()
    # Super fast: enabled filtering + component matching

# GOOD - Specific component query
class_name ProjectileSystem extends System
func query():
    return q.with_all([C_Projectile, C_Velocity])  # Fast and specific

# AVOID - Group-based queries (slow)
class_name PlayerSystem extends System
func query():
    return q.with_group(["player"])  # Use q.with_all([C_Player]) instead

# AVOID - Overly broad queries
class_name UniversalMovementSystem extends System
func query():
    return q.with_all([C_Transform])  # Too broad - matches everything
```

## Entity Prefabs (Scene Files)

### Using Godot Scenes as Entity Prefabs

The most powerful pattern in GECS is using Godot's scene system (.tscn files) as entity prefabs. This combines ECS data with Godot's visual editor:

```
e_player.tscn Structure:
├── Player (Entity node - extends your e_player.gd class)
│   ├── MeshInstance3D (visual representation)
│   ├── CollisionShape3D (physics collision)
│   ├── AudioStreamPlayer3D (sound effects)
│   └── SkeletonAttachment3D (for equipment)
```

**Benefits of Scene-based Prefabs:**

- **Visual Editing**: Design entities in Godot's 3D editor
- **Component Assignment**: Set up ECS components in the Inspector
- **Godot Integration**: Leverage existing Godot nodes and systems
- **Reusability**: Instantiate the same prefab multiple times
- **Version Control**: Scene files work well with git

**Setting up Entity Prefabs:**

1. **Create scene with Entity as root**: `e_player.tscn` with `Player` entity node.
   - Another trick here is to add a CharacterBody3d and then extend that CharacterBody3D with the e_player.gd script this way you get Entity class and CharacterBody3D class data
2. **Add visual/physics children**: Add MeshInstance3D, CollisionShape3D, etc. as children
3. **Configure components in Inspector**: Add components to the `component_resources` array
4. **Save as reusable prefab**: Save the .tscn file for instantiation
5. **Set up on_ready()**: Handle any initialization logic

### Component Assignment in Prefabs

**Method 1: Inspector Assignment (Recommended)**

Set up components directly in the Godot Inspector:

```gdscript
# In e_player.tscn entity root node Inspector:
# Component Resources array:
# - [0] C_Health.new() (max: 100, current: 100)
# - [1] C_Transform.new() (synced with scene transform)
# - [2] C_Input.new() (for player controls)
# - [3] C_LocalPlayer.new() (mark as local player)
```

**Method 2: define_components() (Programmatic)**

```gdscript
# e_player.gd attached to Player.tscn root
class_name Player
extends Entity

func define_components() -> Array:
    return [
        C_Health.new(100),
        C_Transform.new(),
        C_Input.new(),
        C_LocalPlayer.new()
    ]

func on_ready():
    # Initialize after components are ready
    if has_component(C_Transform):
        var transform_comp = get_component(C_Transform)
        transform_comp.transform = global_transform
    add_to_group("player")
```

**Method 3: Hybrid Approach**

```gdscript
# Core components via Inspector, dynamic components via script
func on_ready():
    # Sync scene transform to component
    if has_component(C_Transform):
        var transform_comp = get_component(C_Transform)
        transform_comp.transform = global_transform

    # Add conditional components based on game state
    if GameState.is_multiplayer:
        add_component(C_NetworkSync.new())

    if GameState.debug_mode:
        add_component(C_DebugInfo.new())
```

### Instantiating Entity Prefabs

**Basic Spawning Pattern:**

```gdscript
# Spawn system or main scene
@export var player_prefab: PackedScene
@export var enemy_prefab: PackedScene

func spawn_player(position: Vector3) -> Entity:
    var player = player_prefab.instantiate() as Entity
    player.global_position = position
    get_tree().current_scene.add_child(player)  # Add to scene
    ECS.world.add_entity(player)  # Register with ECS
    return player

func spawn_enemy(position: Vector3) -> Entity:
    var enemy = enemy_prefab.instantiate() as Entity
    enemy.global_position = position
    get_tree().current_scene.add_child(enemy)
    ECS.world.add_entity(enemy)
    return enemy
```

**Advanced Spawning with SpawnSystem:**

```gdscript
# s_spawner.gd
class_name SpawnerSystem
extends System

func query():
    return q.with_all([C_SpawnPoint])

func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        var spawn_point = entity.get_component(C_SpawnPoint)

        if spawn_point.should_spawn():
            var spawned = spawn_point.prefab.instantiate() as Entity
            spawned.global_position = entity.global_position
            get_tree().current_scene.add_child(spawned)
            ECS.world.add_entity(spawned)

            spawn_point.mark_spawned()
```

**Prefab Management Best Practices:**

```gdscript
# Organize prefabs in preload statements
const PLAYER_PREFAB = preload("res://entities/gameplay/e_player.tscn")
const ENEMY_PREFAB = preload("res://entities/enemies/e_enemy.tscn")
const WEAPON_PREFAB = preload("res://entities/items/e_weapon.tscn")

# Or use a prefab registry
class_name PrefabRegistry

static var prefabs = {
    "player": preload("res://entities/gameplay/e_player.tscn"),
    "enemy": preload("res://entities/enemies/e_enemy.tscn"),
    "weapon": preload("res://entities/items/e_weapon.tscn")
}

static func spawn(prefab_name: String, position: Vector3) -> Entity:
    var prefab = prefabs[prefab_name]
    var entity = prefab.instantiate() as Entity
    entity.global_position = position
    get_tree().current_scene.add_child(entity)
    ECS.world.add_entity(entity)
    return entity
```

## Main Scene Architecture

### Scene Structure Pattern

Organize your main scene using the proven structure pattern:

```
Main.tscn
├── World (World node)
├── DefaultSystems (Node - instantiated from default_systems.tscn)
│   ├── run-first (Node - SystemGroup)
│   │   ├── VictimInitSystem
│   │   └── EcsStorageLoad
│   ├── input (Node - SystemGroup)
│   │   ├── ItemSystem
│   │   ├── WeaponsSystem
│   │   └── PlayerControlsSystem
│   ├── gameplay (Node - SystemGroup)
│   │   ├── GearSystem
│   │   ├── DeathSystem
│   │   └── EventSystem
│   ├── physics (Node - SystemGroup)
│   │   ├── FrictionSystem
│   │   ├── CharacterBody3DSystem
│   │   └── TransformSystem
│   ├── ui (Node - SystemGroup)
│   │   └── UiVisibilitySystem
│   ├── debug (Node - SystemGroup)
│   │   └── DebugLabel3DSystem
│   └── run-last (Node - SystemGroup)
│       ├── ActionsSystem
│       └── PendingDeleteSystem
├── Level (Node3D - for level geometry)
└── Entities (Node3D - spawned entities go here)
```

### Systems Setup in Main Scene

**Scene-based Systems Setup (Recommended)**

Use scene composition to organize systems. The default_systems.tscn contains all systems organized by execution groups:

```gdscript
# main.gd - Simple main scene setup
extends Node

@onready var world: World = $World

func _ready():
    Bootstrap.bootstrap()  # Initialize any game-specific setup
    ECS.world = world
    # Systems are automatically registered via scene composition
```

**Creating a Default Systems Scene:**

1. Create `default_systems.tscn` with system groups as Node children
2. Add individual system scripts as children of each group
3. Instantiate this scene in your main scene
4. Systems are automatically discovered and registered by the World

### Processing Systems by Group

```gdscript
# main.gd - Process systems in correct order
extends Node3D

func _process(delta):
    if ECS.world:
        ECS.process(delta, "input")     # Handle input first
        ECS.process(delta, "core")      # Core logic
        ECS.process(delta, "gameplay")  # Game mechanics
        ECS.process(delta, "render")    # UI/visual updates last

func _physics_process(delta):
    if ECS.world:
        ECS.process(delta, "physics")   # Physics systems
```

## Common Utility Patterns

### Transform Synchronization

Common transform synchronization patterns:

```gdscript
# Sync entity transform TO component (scene -> component)
static func sync_transform_to_component(entity: Entity):
    if entity.has_component(C_Transform):
        var transform_comp = entity.get_component(C_Transform)
        transform_comp.transform = entity.global_transform

# Sync component transform TO entity (component -> scene)
static func sync_component_to_transform(entity: Entity):
    if entity.has_component(C_Transform):
        var transform_comp = entity.get_component(C_Transform)
        entity.global_transform = transform_comp.transform

# Common usage in entity on_ready()
func on_ready():
    sync_transform_to_component(self)  # Sync scene position to C_Transform
```

### Component Helpers

Build helpers for common component operations:

```gdscript
# Helper functions you can add to your project
static func add_health_to_entity(entity: Entity, max_health: float):
    var health = C_Health.new(max_health)
    entity.add_component(health)
    return health

static func damage_entity(entity: Entity, amount: float):
    if entity.has_component(C_Health):
        var health = entity.get_component(C_Health)
        health.current = max(0, health.current - amount)
        return health.current <= 0  # Return true if entity died
    return false
```

## Relationship Management Best Practices

### Limited Removal Patterns

**Use Descriptive Constants:**

```gdscript
# Good - Clear intent with constants
const WEAK_CLEANSE = 1
const MEDIUM_CLEANSE = 3
const STRONG_CLEANSE = -1  # All

# Good - Stack-based constants
const SINGLE_STACK = 1
const PARTIAL_STACKS = 3
const ALL_STACKS = -1

func cleanse_debuffs(entity: Entity, power: int):
    match power:
        1: entity.remove_relationship(Relations.any_debuff(), WEAK_CLEANSE)
        2: entity.remove_relationship(Relations.any_debuff(), MEDIUM_CLEANSE)
        3: entity.remove_relationship(Relations.any_debuff(), STRONG_CLEANSE)
```

**Validate Before Removal:**

```gdscript
# Excellent - Safe removal with validation
func safe_partial_heal(entity: Entity, heal_amount: int):
    var damage_rels = entity.get_relationships(Relations.any_damage())
    if damage_rels.is_empty():
        print("Entity has no damage to heal")
        return

    var to_heal = min(heal_amount, damage_rels.size())
    entity.remove_relationship(Relations.any_damage(), to_heal)
    print("Healed ", to_heal, " damage effects")

# Good - Helper function with built-in safety
func remove_poison_stacks(entity: Entity, stacks_to_remove: int):
    if stacks_to_remove <= 0:
        return
    entity.remove_relationship(Relations.poison_effect(), stacks_to_remove)
```

**System Integration Patterns:**

```gdscript
# Excellent - Integration with game systems
class_name StatusEffectSystem extends System

func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    # Example: process spell casting entities
    for entity in entities:
        var spell = entity.get_component(C_SpellCaster)
        if spell.is_casting_cleanse():
            process_cleanse_spell(entity, spell.target, spell.power)

func process_cleanse_spell(caster: Entity, target: Entity, spell_power: int):
    # Calculate cleanse strength based on spell power and caster stats
    var cleanse_strength = calculate_cleanse_strength(caster, spell_power)

    # Apply graduated cleansing based on strength
    match cleanse_strength:
        1..3:   target.remove_relationship(Relations.any_debuff(), 1)
        4..6:   target.remove_relationship(Relations.any_debuff(), 2)
        7..9:   target.remove_relationship(Relations.any_debuff(), 3)
        _:      target.remove_relationship(Relations.any_debuff())  # Remove all

func process_antidote_item(user: Entity, antidote_strength: int):
    # Remove poison based on antidote quality
    user.remove_relationship(Relations.poison_effect(), antidote_strength)

    # Remove poison resistance temporarily to prevent immediate repoison
    user.add_relationship(Relations.poison_immunity(), 5.0)  # 5 second immunity

class_name InventorySystem extends System

func consume_item_stack(entity: Entity, item_type: Script, count: int):
    # Consume specific number of items from inventory
    entity.remove_relationship(
        Relationship.new(C_HasItem.new(), item_type),
        count
    )

func use_consumable(entity: Entity, item: Component, quantity: int = 1):
    # Use consumable items with quantity
    entity.remove_relationship(
        Relationship.new(C_HasItem.new(), item),
        quantity
    )
```

**Performance Optimization:**

```gdscript
# Good - Cache relationships for multiple operations
func optimize_bulk_removal(entity: Entity):
    # Cache the relationship for reuse
    var poison_rel = Relations.poison_effect()
    var damage_rel = Relations.any_damage()

    # Multiple targeted removals
    entity.remove_relationship(poison_rel, 2)      # Remove 2 poison
    entity.remove_relationship(damage_rel, 1)      # Remove 1 damage
    entity.remove_relationship(poison_rel, 1)      # Remove 1 more poison

# Excellent - Batch removal patterns
func batch_cleanup(entities: Array[Entity]):
    var cleanup_rel = Relations.temporary_effect()

    for entity in entities:
        # Remove up to 3 temporary effects from each entity
        entity.remove_relationship(cleanup_rel, 3)
```

## Production Patterns from Real Projects

These patterns are drawn from production GECS projects and address common architectural challenges that emerge at scale.

### Relationship Factory Class

Rather than constructing `Relationship.new(...)` inline throughout your code, collect all common relationships in a single `Rels` static class. This gives you one place to rename or adjust relationships and keeps system code readable.

Naming convention: `R_<Action>_<Target>` for the component, e.g. `R_ChildOf`, `R_Attacks`, `R_Equips`.

```gdscript
# rels.gd
class_name Rels

static var child_of: Relationship = Relationship.new(R_ChildOf.new(), null)
static var attacks: Relationship = Relationship.new(R_Attacks.new(), null)
static var equips: Relationship = Relationship.new(R_Equips.new(), null)

static func child_of_entity(parent: Entity) -> Relationship:
    return Relationship.new(R_ChildOf.new(), parent)

static func attacks_target(target: Entity) -> Relationship:
    return Relationship.new(R_Attacks.new(), target)
```

```gdscript
# Usage in systems — clean, no inline Relationship construction
func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        if entity.has_relationship(Rels.attacks):
            apply_attack(entity)
        entity.remove_relationship(Rels.child_of, 1)
```

### Sub-systems for Complex Logic

When a system needs multiple distinct queries — e.g. a WeaponsSystem that handles both firing and reloading — use `sub_systems()` to declare each query/process pair cleanly. This avoids stuffing multiple unrelated queries into a single `query()` method.

```gdscript
# s_weapons.gd
class_name WeaponsSystem
extends System

func sub_systems() -> Array[Array]:
    return [
        [q.with_all([C_Weapon, C_Firing]), handle_firing],
        [q.with_all([C_Weapon, C_Reloading]), handle_reloading]
    ]

func handle_firing(entities: Array[Entity], _components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        var weapon = entity.get_component(C_Weapon)
        weapon.fire_timer -= delta
        if weapon.fire_timer <= 0:
            cmd.add_component(entity, C_ProjectileSpawn.new(weapon.muzzle_position))
            weapon.fire_timer = weapon.fire_rate

func handle_reloading(entities: Array[Entity], _components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        var weapon = entity.get_component(C_Weapon)
        weapon.reload_timer -= delta
        if weapon.reload_timer <= 0:
            weapon.ammo = weapon.max_ammo
            cmd.remove_component(entity, C_Reloading)
```

### PendingDelete Pattern

Direct `cmd.remove_entity()` deletes entities immediately after the system. For entities that need a visible death animation, a sound effect, or just a one-frame delay, add a `C_IsPendingDelete` tag component and let a dedicated `PendingDeleteSystem` handle the actual removal.

```gdscript
# c_is_pending_delete.gd
class_name C_IsPendingDelete
extends Component

@export var delete_delay: float = 0.0  # 0 = next frame, >0 = timed delay
```

```gdscript
# s_pending_delete.gd — runs in "run-last" group
class_name PendingDeleteSystem
extends System

func query():
    return q.with_all([C_IsPendingDelete])

func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        var pending = entity.get_component(C_IsPendingDelete)
        if pending.delete_delay <= 0.0:
            cmd.remove_entity(entity)
        else:
            pending.delete_delay -= delta
```

```gdscript
# Any system can stage an entity for deletion without immediate removal
func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    for entity in entities:
        var health = entity.get_component(C_Health)
        if health.current <= 0:
            # Play death anim, then delete after 0.5s
            cmd.add_component(entity, C_IsPendingDelete.new())
            entity.get_component(C_IsPendingDelete).delete_delay = 0.5
```

This pattern cleanly separates "mark for deletion" from "actually remove", keeps your iteration systems simple, and gives you a single place to add cleanup logic (sound, VFX, loot drops) before the entity disappears.
