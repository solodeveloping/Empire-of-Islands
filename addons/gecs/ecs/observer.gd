## An [Observer] is a query-driven reactive node. Declare a [QueryBuilder] with event
## modifiers (on_added/on_removed/on_changed/on_match/on_unmatch/on_relationship_added/
## on_relationship_removed/on_event) and the observer fires its [method each] callback
## whenever one of those events occurs on an entity matching the query.
##
## [b]Quick example:[/b]
## [codeblock]
## class_name HealthObserver
## extends Observer
##
## func query() -> QueryBuilder:
##     return q.with_all([C_Health, C_Player]).on_added().on_removed()
##
## func each(event: Variant, entity: Entity, payload: Variant) -> void:
##     match event:
##         Observer.Event.ADDED:   print("Health granted: ", payload)
##         Observer.Event.REMOVED: print("Health lost from: ", entity.name)
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]Multiple reactive axes — split with [method sub_observers]:[/b]
## [codeblock]
## func sub_observers() -> Array[Array]:
##     return [
##         [q.with_all([C_Health]).on_added(),     _on_join],
##         [q.with_all([C_Health]).on_removed(),   _on_die],
##         [q.with_all([C_Player]).on_event(&"damage_dealt"), _on_damage],
##     ]
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]Property-change observers:[/b] [method each] fires only when a component explicitly
## emits [signal Component.property_changed]. Setting a property directly does not trigger
## observers. Components that want change events must implement a setter that emits
## [code]property_changed[/code] — this is intentional for performance.
##
## [b]Upgrading from GECS 7.x?[/b] The legacy Observer API ([code]watch()[/code], [code]match()[/code],
## [code]on_component_added/removed/changed()[/code]) was removed in v8.0.0. See
## [code]addons/gecs/docs/MIGRATION_LEGACY_OBSERVER.md[/code].

#region Enums
## Event types an [Observer]'s [QueryBuilder] can react to. Sequential values — the
## framework derives bit flags internally (via [code]1 << event[/code]) for the
## [member QueryBuilder._observer_events_mask] storage.
enum Event {
	ADDED = 0,  ## A watched component was added to a matching entity.
	REMOVED = 1,  ## A watched component was removed from a matching entity.
	CHANGED = 2,  ## A watched property changed on a watched component.
	MATCH = 3,  ## Monitor: entity newly satisfies the query.
	UNMATCH = 4,  ## Monitor: entity no longer satisfies the query.
	RELATIONSHIP_ADDED = 5,  ## A relationship was added to a matching entity.
	RELATIONSHIP_REMOVED = 6,  ## A relationship was removed from a matching entity.

## Controls when the observer's [member cmd] [CommandBuffer] executes queued structural changes.

#region Exported Variables
## If false the observer is skipped entirely (no event callbacks fire).

## Convenience property that returns a **fresh** [QueryBuilder] on every access.
## Mirrors [member System.q]: each access builds a new builder bound to this observer's
## world, so sub_observers can call [code]q.with_all(...)[/code] independently per tuple
## without them sharing mutable state. If the observer is not yet attached to a world,
## returns the global [code]ECS.world.query[/code] builder or null.
var q: QueryBuilder:
	get:
		return _world.query if _world else (ECS.world.query if ECS.world else null)

## Reference to the [World] this observer belongs to (set by [method World.add_observer]).

## Command buffer for queuing structural changes from event callbacks. Lazy — created on first access.

## Override and return a [QueryBuilder] with event modifiers chained on it
## (e.g. [code]q.with_all([C_Health]).on_added()[/code]) to declare this observer's

## The unified observer callback. Fires for every event declared on [method query].[br]
## [param event] An [enum Observer.Event] value or a [StringName] for custom events.[br]
## [param entity] The [Entity] the event concerns.[br]
## [param payload] Event-type-dependent data; see the payload table in the class doc.

## Override to return a list of sub-observer tuples. Tuple shape:
## [code][QueryBuilder, Callable, optional yield_existing_override][/code].
## The callable receives [code](event, entity, payload)[/code] — identical to [method each].[br]
## The 3rd element, when non-null, overrides the parent observer's [member yield_existing]
## flag for this tuple only. Pass [code]true[/code] to force retroactive fire for pre-existing
## entities, or [code]false[/code] to suppress it. Leave null (or omit) to inherit the parent.[br]
## Observers are event-driven and do NOT accept a [SystemTimer] — to throttle observer work,
## use [code]FlushMode.MANUAL[/code] + [code]cmd.add_custom(callable)[/code] and flush from
## a timed System.[br]
